# Final-Year-Project
I studied Economic Informatics BA at the University of Babes-Bolyai in years 2022 - 2025. This repository is for my final year project. The project contains webscraping and data analysis and it is conducted on Romanian online bookstore market.

# Thesis
Using public data from Romanian online bookstores can determine demand trends in the book market without direct sales statistics.

# Websites
Three big online bookstores is present in the Romanian market, so I choosed to scrape these websites. To my best knowledge scraping is legal since the data is public, although websites can defend against this with multiple techniques. Fortunately, the three websites I choosed don't protect themselves.

1. Carturesti.ro
2. Libris.ro
3. Bookline.ro

# Method
The webscraping has two main part:
1. scraping all the titles from the main page
2. scraping every public data for each title
   
Since the websites are different and the accessible public data differs on books, the gathered data needs to be clustered. We are interested in the following data of a book:
Bookstore, Title, Author, Price, Reviews, Score, Genres, Number of Pages, Publisher, Publishing Date, Cover Type, Language, Translator.

Then the analysis and visualization comes. The goal is to reach useful and interesting conclusions while exploring the correlations for both sides of the market's participants: buyer and seller.
