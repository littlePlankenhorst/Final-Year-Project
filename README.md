# Final-Year-Project
I studied Business Informatics BA at the University of Babes-Bolyai in years 2022 - 2025. This repository is for my final year project. The project contains webscraping and data analysis and it is conducted on Romanian online bookstore's market.

# Websites
Three big online bookstores is present in the Romanian market, so I choosed to scrape these websites. To my best knowledge scraping is legal since the data is public, although websites can defend against this with multiple techniques. Fortunately, the three websites I choosed don't protect themselves.

1. Carturesti.ro
2. Libris.ro
3. Bookline.ro

# Method
The webscraping has two main part:
1. scraping all the titles from the main page
2. scraping every public data for each title 

Then the analyzis and visualization comes. The goal is to reach useful and interesting conclusions while exploring the correlations for both sides of the market's participants: buyer and seller.
